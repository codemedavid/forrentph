# Seasonal Rental Duration Implementation - Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete

Successfully implemented seasonal rental duration restrictions for the costume rental system.

## 📋 What Was Changed

### 1. **Utility Functions** (`src/lib/utils.ts`)
Added three new functions:
- `getSeasonalRentalRules(date)` - Returns season rules for a given date
- `isRentalDurationAllowed(startDate, durationCode)` - Checks if duration is allowed
- `validateSeasonalRental(startDate, endDate)` - Validates rental period

### 2. **Costume Detail Page** (`src/app/costumes/[slug]/page.tsx`)
- Dynamically filters pricing options based on selected date
- Disables non-allowed durations with visual indicators
- Shows seasonal information banner
- Auto-adjusts duration selection when changing dates between seasons

### 3. **Booking API** (`src/app/api/bookings/route.ts`)
- Added backend validation for seasonal rules
- Returns clear error messages (HTTP 400) for invalid durations
- Validates before checking availability

### 4. **Booking Form** (`src/components/booking-form.tsx`)
- Displays seasonal information banner
- Shows clear context about current season restrictions

### 5. **Booking Page** (`src/app/booking/page.tsx`)
- Added seasonal info card in the sidebar
- Provides visual context throughout booking flow

### 6. **Documentation**
- Created `SEASONAL_RENTAL_RULES.md` with comprehensive documentation
- Includes testing scenarios, customization guide, and technical details

## 🎯 Business Rules Implemented

### Peak Season (October - December)
- **Allowed**: 12-hour rentals ONLY
- **Visual**: Orange/amber theme with 🎃 emoji
- **Reason**: High demand period requires faster turnover

### Regular Season (January - September)
- **Allowed**: 24 hours (1 day) or longer
- **Options**: 1 day, 3 days, 1 week
- **Visual**: Blue theme with 📅 emoji
- **Reason**: Lower demand allows longer rental periods

## 🎨 User Experience

### Before Selecting Date
- All pricing options visible
- Helper text: "Select a date to see available options"

### After Selecting Date
**Peak Season (Oct-Dec):**
- Only 12h option enabled
- Other options grayed out with "Not available" text
- Orange banner explains peak season rules

**Regular Season (Jan-Sep):**
- 1d, 3d, 1w options enabled
- 12h option grayed out with "Not available" text
- Blue banner explains regular season rules

### Error Handling
If user attempts invalid booking (e.g., via URL manipulation):
```
Error 400: Invalid rental duration for season
"During peak season (October-December), only 12-hour rentals are available."
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

Test these scenarios to verify implementation:

- [ ] **Test 1**: Select October date → Only 12h available
- [ ] **Test 2**: Select June date → 1d, 3d, 1w available (not 12h)
- [ ] **Test 3**: Select date in September, then change to October → Duration auto-updates
- [ ] **Test 4**: Try to book 24h in December → Booking rejected with error
- [ ] **Test 5**: Try to book 12h in March → Booking rejected with error
- [ ] **Test 6**: Complete successful 12h booking in November
- [ ] **Test 7**: Complete successful 3d booking in May

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Customers
1. Visit `/costumes/[costume-slug]`
2. Select a date from the calendar
3. Available rental durations automatically filter
4. Proceed with allowed duration only

### For Admins
Rules are centralized in `src/lib/utils.ts`. To modify:
```typescript
// Change the month ranges or allowed durations
export function getSeasonalRentalRules(date: Date) {
  const month = date.getMonth() + 1;
  
  // Modify these conditions as needed
  if (month >= 10 && month <= 12) {
    return {
      season: 'peak',
      allowedDurations: ['12h'],  // Change this
      minHours: 12,
      description: 'Your custom description'
    };
  }
  // ...
}
```

## 🎉 Benefits

1. **Business Optimization**: Faster turnover during peak season
2. **Clear Communication**: Customers understand restrictions before booking
3. **Data Integrity**: Backend validation prevents invalid bookings
4. **Better UX**: Visual feedback guides users to valid choices
5. **Flexibility**: Easy to adjust rules in one place
