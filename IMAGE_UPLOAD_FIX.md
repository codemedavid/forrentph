# Image Upload Fix - Costume Edit Mode

## Issue
When editing a costume in the admin panel, the previous images were not showing in the costume form modal. This meant:
- Users couldn't see existing images when editing
- Users couldn't add new images while keeping old ones
- Users would lose all previous images if they saved without re-uploading

## Root Cause
The `ImageUpload` component was using `useState` to initialize the images array, which only runs once when the component first mounts. When the modal opened with different costume data, the `currentImages` prop would change, but the internal `images` state would not update.

### Before (Broken Code)
```typescript
// src/components/admin/image-upload.tsx
export function ImageUpload({ currentImages = [], ... }: ImageUploadProps) {
  const [images, setImages] = useState<string[]>(currentImages); // ❌ Only initializes once
  // ... rest of component
}
```

## Solution
Added a `useEffect` hook to synchronize the internal `images` state whenever the `currentImages` prop changes.

### After (Fixed Code)
```typescript
// src/components/admin/image-upload.tsx
import { useState, useRef, useEffect } from 'react';

export function ImageUpload({ currentImages = [], ... }: ImageUploadProps) {
  const [images, setImages] = useState<string[]>(currentImages);
  
  // ✅ Sync images state when currentImages prop changes
  useEffect(() => {
    setImages(currentImages);
  }, [currentImages]);
  
  // ... rest of component
}
```

## Changes Made
1. **File Modified**: `/src/components/admin/image-upload.tsx`
2. **Lines Changed**: 3, 26-29
3. **Changes**:
   - Added `useEffect` to the imports from 'react'
   - Added useEffect hook to sync images state with currentImages prop

## Testing Steps

### Test 1: Add New Costume
1. Go to Admin Dashboard
2. Click "Add Costume" button
3. Fill in costume details
4. Upload 2-3 images
5. Save costume
6. ✅ Verify costume is created with all images

### Test 2: Edit Existing Costume (Main Fix)
1. Go to Admin Dashboard → Inventory tab
2. Click "Edit" on a costume that has images
3. ✅ **Verify all existing images appear in the image upload section**
4. ✅ Verify you can see the primary image badge on first image
5. Upload 1-2 additional images
6. ✅ Verify both old and new images are visible
7. Save costume
8. ✅ Verify all images (old + new) are saved

### Test 3: Remove Images When Editing
1. Edit a costume with multiple images
2. ✅ Verify all images appear
3. Remove one or two images using the X button
4. Add a new image
5. Save costume
6. ✅ Verify only the kept + new images are saved

### Test 4: Edit Multiple Costumes in Sequence
1. Edit Costume A (with 3 images)
2. ✅ Verify Costume A's 3 images appear
3. Close modal without saving
4. Edit Costume B (with 2 different images)
5. ✅ Verify Costume B's 2 images appear (not Costume A's)
6. This tests that the useEffect properly updates when switching between costumes

### Test 5: Edit Without Changing Images
1. Edit a costume with images
2. ✅ Verify images appear
3. Change only text fields (name, description, price, etc.)
4. Save costume
5. ✅ Verify images remain unchanged

## Expected Behavior Now

### When Adding a New Costume:
- Image upload section starts empty
- Can upload up to 5 images
- First uploaded image becomes primary

### When Editing a Costume:
- **All existing images appear immediately** ✨
- Can remove existing images
- Can add new images (up to 5 total)
- Can mix old and new images
- First image in the list is primary
- Images are saved when form is submitted

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
```
Admin Page
  └─> handleCostumeClick(costume)
      └─> setSelectedCostume(costume)
          └─> CostumeFormModal
              └─> useEffect sets formData.images = costume.images
                  └─> ImageUpload component
                      └─> currentImages prop = formData.images
                          └─> useEffect syncs internal state ✅
                              └─> Images display in UI
```

### Props Flow
1. `costume` object (includes `images: string[]`)
2. → `CostumeFormModal` receives as prop
3. → Sets `formData.images` in useEffect
4. → Passes to `<ImageUpload currentImages={formData.images} />`
5. → **NEW**: useEffect in ImageUpload syncs state when prop changes
6. → Images render in the component

## Related Files
- `/src/components/admin/image-upload.tsx` - Fixed file
- `/src/components/admin/costume-form-modal.tsx` - Uses ImageUpload
- `/src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Calls CostumeFormModal
- `/src/app/api/costumes/[id]/route.ts` - Saves costume data

## Notes
- This fix also benefits any future features that use the ImageUpload component
- The component now properly reacts to prop changes, making it more reusable
- No breaking changes to the API or data structure
- Backward compatible with existing costumes

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Ready for testing
