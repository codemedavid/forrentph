# ✅ Fixed: Book Now Button

## 🐛 Problem

When clicking "Book Now" on a costume from the database, the page would just refresh instead of showing the booking form.

### Root Cause:

The booking page (`/app/booking/page.tsx`) was only looking for costumes in **mock data** instead of fetching from the **database API**.

When you clicked "Book Now":
1. ✅ Button correctly linked to `/booking?costumeId=xxx&startDate=...&endDate=...`
2. ❌ Booking page tried to find costume in mock data
3. ❌ Costume not found (because it's in database, not mock)
4. ❌ Page redirected back to `/costumes`
5. ❌ Looked like a page refresh to the user

---

## ✅ Solution

Updated the booking page to:
1. **Fetch costume from API** (`/api/costumes/[id]`) first
2. **Fall back to mock data** if API fails (for development)
3. **Show loading state** while fetching
4. **Better error logging** to debug issues

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### File: `src/app/booking/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Only looked in mock data
const foundCostume = costumes.find(c => c.id === costumeId);
if (!foundCostume) {
  router.push('/costumes'); // Redirect back (looks like refresh)
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Fetch from API first
const response = await fetch(`/api/costumes/${costumeId}`);
if (response.ok) {
  foundCostume = await response.json();
} else {
  // Fallback to mock data
  foundCostume = costumes.find(c => c.id === costumeId);
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still redirecting back

**Check console for:**
```
❌ Missing booking parameters
```

**Cause:** URL parameters missing or invalid

**Fix:** Make sure you click "Book Now" from costume detail page after selecting dates

---

### Issue: "Costume not found"

**Check console for:**
```
⚠️ Costume not in database, checking mock data
❌ Invalid costume or dates
```

**Cause:** Costume doesn't exist in database OR mock data

**Fix:** 
1. Make sure costume was saved successfully in admin panel
2. Check Supabase table editor to verify costume exists

---

### Issue: Page loads but form doesn't submit

**Check console for:**
```
❌ Booking failed: [error message]
```

**Cause:** Database schema not updated for blocking system

**Fix:** Run `supabase-blocking-schema.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
